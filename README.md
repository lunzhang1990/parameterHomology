# parameterHomology

1. polyhedraComplex1.0.ipynb used to generate the polhedra complex structure for each node type. The results are stored in file like x_o_1.json.

2. Repressilator and ToggelSwitch1.0 are used to compute the homology of parameter regions.

3. FourierElimination is used to show a computational lower bound for some cases, when the node type is not too big. It is always easier to use compared to the theoretically doubly exponential lower bound from the paper's theore.
